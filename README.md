# zfista : A globally convergent fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm with a new momentum factor for single and multi-objective (convex) optimization

This code repository provides a solver for the proximal gradient method (ISTA) and its acceleration (FISTA) for both single and multi-objective optimization problems, including the experimental code for the [Paper1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10994 "An accelerated proximal gradient method for multiobjective optimization") and [Paper2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05262 "A globally convergent fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm with a new momentum factor for single and multi-objective convex optimization").

The solver can deal with the unconstrained problem written by
$$\min_{x \in \mathbf{R}^n} \quad F(x) \coloneqq f(x) + g(x),$$
where $f$ and $g$ are scalar or vector valued function, $f$ is continuously differentiable, $g$ is closed, proper and convex.
Note that FISTA also requires $f$ to be convex.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or later

## Install
```sh
pip install zfista
```
